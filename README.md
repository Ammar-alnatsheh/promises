# promises
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

Promises are a very powerful abstraction on top of callbacks and many asynchronous libraries are starting to use them by default. They are included as a language standard in ES6, and with future versions building them up even further, now is a great time to learn.

This sprint is designed to ease you into using implementing and consuming promises by comparing them to the callback pattern you are already familiar with.
